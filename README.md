# Sorting Algorithms

Algorithms are descriptions, step by step, to carry out some speciffic task.<br>
One type of problem what can be solved using an algorithm is the elements sorting, such as numbers or words.<br>
That task can be fixed in differents ways, that is, there are many algoritms capable of producing the same result. <br>
However, in many situations, the process is just as important as the result, and one specific algorithm may be more suitable than
another, even if their results are identicals. <br>
<br>

To practice programming logic, four types of sorting algorithms have been built in this repository:
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort
* Selection Sort

The algorithm was written using the Java language, and Integer Arrays were used as the group of elements.
